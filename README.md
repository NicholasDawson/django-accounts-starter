# django-accounts-starter
Django3 example and starter code for a more modern authentication/account system.

## Features
Uses (Argon2id)[https://github.com/hynek/argon2-cffi] for password hashing and (django-mailer)[https://github.com/pinax/django-mailer] for async mailing of password
reset emails so the system is less vulnerable to timing attacks.
